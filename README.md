## Hi, I'm Andres 👋

Computer Engineering student at the **Tecnológico de Costa Rica ** with a strong focus on **databases and backend systems**. I have hands-on experience building **data-driven applications**, designing relational schemas, and implementing business logic with transactional integrity.

I work primarily with **Java, Python and SQL**, developing backend components, ETL pipelines, and database-centric solutions. I also have experience deploying and managing services in **containerized environments** using **Docker and Kubernetes**, applying good practices in architecture, automation, and technical documentation.

Beyond the technical side, I am a **student-athlete**, which has strengthened my discipline, time management, and ability to perform consistently under pressure—skills that translate directly into engineering work and team collaboration.
